            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">1. General Information</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Xpendora ("the app") is an expense tracker designed to manage personal expenses and income. This policy explains how we handle your information.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">2. Data We Collect</h2>
            <h3>a) Authentication Data (Clerk)</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">To log in, we use Clerk as an identity provider. We collect your name, email address, and profile picture (as allowed by the social login provider: Google, Apple, etc.).</p>
            <p class="mb-5">We do not store passwords; Clerk securely manages authentication.</p>
            <h3>b) Financial Data (local)</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">The app stores transactions (expenses/income), categories, and budgets only in SQLite on your device.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">No financial data is sent to external servers or accessible by us.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Authentication data (email, name) is only used to identify your account within the app. Financial data is processed locally to generate reports and statistics.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">4. Storage and Security</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">Your financial data never leaves your device (local SQLite). Clerk encrypts and protects your login data under its Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p class="mb-5">We recommend securing your device with a password or biometrics to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">5. Data Sharing with Third Parties</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">We do not share financial data with anyone (neither advertising nor analytics). Clerk may use login data according to its policy but does not access your transactions.</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">6. Deleting Your Data</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">To delete authentication data: Cancel your account from the Clerk settings section. To delete financial data: Uninstall the app (this will delete the local SQLite database).</p>
            <h2 class="mb-5 font-semibold">7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">We will notify you of significant updates within the app.</p>
